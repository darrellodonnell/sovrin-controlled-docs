# POLICIES

## Steward Invitation Policy

1. The Sovrin Foundation MUST invite only Organizations meeting the Steward Qualifications to become a Steward.
2. For the Provisional Network, the Sovrin Foundationâ€™s Steward invitation process:
   1. SHOULD follow the principle of System Diversity.
   2. SHOULD follow the principle of Diffuse Trust.
   3. SHOULD give priority to qualified Organizations who volunteer to make the
commitment to serve as a Founding Steward.
   4. SHOULD give priority to Social Purpose Organizations.

3. When the Board of Trustees determines that there is a sufficient number of Stewards, the Sovrin Trust Framework SHOULD be revised to incorporate policies for ensuring System Diversity and Diffuse Trust that can be enforced algorithmically and dynamically by the Sovrin Open Source Code operating on all Nodes to determine which Nodes should be operating as Validator Nodes when they should so operate.

## Sovrin Steward Onboarding Process

1. Upon executing the Steward Agreement the goal is to activate the Steward Node within 30-days of signing. TK: replace with text that once Node is active, algorithm will add it to the "pool"

2. In the event that 


//TODO/TK: get current onboarding process doc.



## Sovrin Steward Disqualification and Remediation Policy

A Steward will be removed from the Active Steward list when any of the following have occured:

* their Node(s) have failed to achieve 98% availability.
* an Intrusion has been reported.
* ...



### Warning Period

Prior to full disqualification a Steward will be put into Suspension mode and be provided a chance to rectify the issues that caused their removal from the Active Steward list. 

#### Warning Period Remediation

A Steward that can satisfy the TGB that the conditions that caused Suspension can be returned to the Active Steward list. Failure to satisfy the TGB that a Steward has remediated the situation within __30__ days will automatically result in the Steward being Disqualified.

#### Disqualified Stewards

A Steward that has been Disqualified must re-apply to become a Steward. Past Steward reliability and prior disqualification will be considered
