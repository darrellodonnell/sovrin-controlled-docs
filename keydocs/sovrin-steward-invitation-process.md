1. The Sovrin Foundation MUST invite only Organizations meeting the Steward
Qualifications to become a Steward.
2. For the Provisional Network, the Sovrin Foundation’s Steward invitation process:
   1. SHOULD follow the principle of System Diversity.
   2. SHOULD follow the principle of Diffuse Trust.
   3. SHOULD give priority to qualified Organizations who volunteer to make the
commitment to serve as a Founding Steward.
   4. SHOULD give priority to Social Purpose Organizations.

3. When the Board of Trustees determines that there is a sufficient number of Stewards, the Sovrin Trust Framework SHOULD be revised to incorporate policies for ensuring System Diversity and Diffuse Trust that can be enforced algorithmically and dynamically by the Sovrin Open Source Code operating on all Nodes to determine which Nodes should be operating as Validator Nodes when they should so operate.
