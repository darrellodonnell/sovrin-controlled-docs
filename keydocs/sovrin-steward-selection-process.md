The Sovrin Network will leverage a DLT that allows for the establishment 
and operation of a public global utility that is sufficient to meet the 
needs of our four basic requirements: governance, scalability, 
accessibility, and privacy.

In recognition that all consensus protocols can only scale to a limited 
number of write-permissioned nodes ("validators"), the approval process 
for entities that are qualified to be granted ledger access must take 
into consideration an entity's ability to sustain the costs of 
supporting a public permissioned ledger. 

It is the responsibility of the governing entity of the permissioned 
network to establish approval criteria and an application review 
process for qualified entities that are willing to sustain the costs 
associated with the operation of a validator node while remaining in 
compliance with the four basic requirements of the network: governance, 
scalability, accessibility, and privacy. 

In the spirit of decentralization and in accordance with our open governance requirements:

* the operation of a validator node must not be bound to or influenced by reward or financial gain of any kind;

* the review criteria for validator nodes to be in the inactive-and-ready pool must ensure that an entity's operation of a validator node must not in anyway place the entity in an economic or power in-balance position with respect to the general users of the public network;  

* a pool of qualified and approved validator nodes will be intermittently and systematically parsed for selection to be part of the active pool. 

The selection process for validator nodes in the active pool needs to balance between diversity and performance based on a standard that is implemented and maintained by the governing entity of the permisisoned network. 

Any and all facets associated with diversity criteria should be within the scope of the following diversity definition "____"    

Any and all facets associated with performance criteria should be within the scope of the following functional, non-functional, operational, and non-operational definition "____"
