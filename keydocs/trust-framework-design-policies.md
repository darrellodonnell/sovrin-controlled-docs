## Network Governance
>This section pertains to the polices associated with the participants and stakeholders that deal with the operation of the network.

1. The Sovrin Foundation is the Trust Framework Authority (TFA) for the Sovrin Network and as such is the governing agent responsible for upholding the Sovrin Trust Framework.  

1. There are four major requirements for the Sovrin Network to meet the needs of a self-sovereign identity network:

  1. Governance: how the network can be trusted by all stakeholders.
  1. Performance: how the network can provide self-sovereign identity at Internet scale.
  1. Accessibility: how the network can ensure that identity is available to all.
  1. Privacy: how the network can meet the strongest privacy standards in the world.

1. The Sovrin Network will leverage a DLT that allows for the establishment and operation of a public global utility that is sufficient to meet the needs of our four major requirements.

1. As an implementation of a public-permissioned global ledger, the Sovrin Network

1. In recognition that all consensus protocols can only scale to a limited number of write-permissioned nodes ("validators"), the approval process for entities that are qualified to be granted ledger access must take into consideration an entity's ability to sustain the costs of supporting a public permissioned ledger.

1. It is the responsibility of the TFA of the permissioned network to establish approval criteria and an application review process for qualified entities that are willing to sustain the costs associated with the operation of a validator node while remaining in compliance with the four basic requirements of the network: governance, scalability, accessibility, and privacy.

1. In the spirit of decentralization and in accordance with our open governance requirements:

   1. the operation of a validator node must not be bound to or influenced by reward or financial gain of any kind;
   1. the review criteria for validator nodes to be in the inactive-and-ready pool must ensure that an entity's operation of a validator node must not in anyway place the entity in an economic or power in-balance position with respect to the general users of the public network;  
   1. a pool of qualified and approved validator nodes will be intermittently and systematically parsed for selection to be part of the active pool.

1. The selection process for validator nodes in the active pool needs to balance between *system diversity* and *performance* based on a standard that is implemented and maintained by the governing entity of the permissioned network. This selection process can be implemented using a scoring algorithm (which is used at network run-time). The algorithm  SHOULD consider the facets of datacenter diversity such as IT staff access, geography, legal, and political jurisdiction as independent factors but these factors must be balanced with historical performance history of a validator node.

1. Any and all facets associated with *system diversity* criteria should be pertain to and be focused on maximize diversity of hosting locations, environments, networks, and systems in order to optimize availability and security.

1. Any and all facets associated with *performance* criteria be pertain to and be focused on both functional and operational elements. Attention should be placed on recorded computational (functional) metrics for a node as well as the track record for the responsiveness of infrastructure and human support (operational) systems. For example, transaction speeds and DDoS attach history needs to be balanced alongside fire-drill grades and upgrade responsiveness.

1. The Steward approval/invitation process MUST provide explicit options for the data center geographic locations at time of approval and those options MUST be refreshed if not acted upon in a specific timeframe.
